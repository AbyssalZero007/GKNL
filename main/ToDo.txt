        For Planetary maps:
            Step 1) Make a copy of template 
            Step 2) Pull data from DB about that planet (with input from the system map, probably)
            Step 3) Build Buildings chart and check if captain account
            Step 4) Write Planet Lore (? Is this in the DB)
            Step 5) Copy Tile Template
            Step 6) build tile map and populate with data from DB
            Step 7) Profit?
