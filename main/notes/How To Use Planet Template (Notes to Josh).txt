1) instantiate 2 unique system sessvars (one for keeping track of the planet and one for keeping track of the system) in system page (These should wipe any 
   other value each time you return to this page, return to the home page, or close the page)
2) call a function on page load to add a number 1 through the number of planets to the unique planet sessvars
3) call another function to add the system number to the second sessvars
4) put these into local variables
5) finally on page load, clear sessvars memory
6) on the planet page check add that sessvars to the amount of planets in all systems before this (identified by the system sessvars) to get its planet id
7) use that planet id to pull tile data
8) use the tile data to build the page
